Team-35-Scrabble-Game
Gaming is a popular entertainment venture, a lot of gaming currently is being done virtually online. In the cit-591 course, we have had the practice of some of the popular games like BlackjackSolitaire as an assignment, and on a basic level Chess, Snakes and Ladders, etc. We want to build on this expertise and scale higher with new games called Scrabble. In this game, a user (or two users) can access and play against each other. In this game, players will have a game board, 15 by 15 tiles, a letter bag, and seven racks. The rule is player 1 clicks the letter in the rack and then clicks any tile on the board to relocate the letter. Each time the player finishes this round, click the submit button to save the words on board, then it will pass to the other player or next round. The more words player made, the more score the player wins. Each letter has its score and some tiles have bonus effects.
 
Implementation Method: 

•Front End GUI:
•JavaFX (needed JDK-11.0.7 for Java)
•Gradle
•Challenges: 
•Setup and Interfacing with Back End
•Handling animation, and event handling

•Back End:
•Implemented the Scrabble Algorithm, and created some new rules for the game
•Using Classes, and different data Structures. 
•Challenges: 
•The Scrabble Algorithm was much more challenging than originally envisioned. 
•Includes storing previously created words, and the scores associated with the letters ONLY as memory (by updating associated objects)
•Also, there are different kinds of scores that need to be considered from the Board and Letters.
•Also check if the word is correct from partially provided word as half the letters were already used previously on the board!
•CRC Cards created at the beginning of the project were very helpful

•Classes for Back End:
•ScrabbleRunner (same as main.java): start GUI  (gameUI)
•GUI: includes inputReader, display, playerList
•ScrabbleGame: includes play, dictionary, playerTurn, gameResult, playAgain, reStartPlay
•Dictionary
•Board: includes currentBoard
•BagOfLetters: includes shuffleAndPickLetters, getCurrentBagOfLetters, removeLetter, addLetters, isEmpty
•WordBuilder
•Letter
•Cell
•ScoreKeeper: scoreOfEachPlayer (TBD: may not be needed, as already available from each Player)
•Player: includes currentTrayOfLetters (Here, 7 for Scrabble), letterSelectionChoice, getTotalScore, getCurrentLetterTray

•Front-End Classes:
•GUI
•Welcome GUI Controller
•Board GUI Controller
